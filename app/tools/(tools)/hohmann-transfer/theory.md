- A **Hohmann transfer** is an orbital maneuver using two engine impulses (burns) to move between two coplanar circular orbits.

- It is generally the most fuel-efficient two-burn maneuver for this type of transfer.

- The transfer occurs along an elliptical orbit that is tangential to both the initial and final circular orbits.

- **ΔV₁**: First burn (at periapsis or apoapsis of the transfer ellipse) changes the spacecraft's velocity to enter the transfer ellipse from the initial orbit.

- **ΔV₂**: Second burn (at the opposite apsis of the transfer ellipse) changes velocity again to match the final circular orbit.

- **Altitude vs. Distance:** This calculator supports two input modes:
  - **Altitude**: Height above Earth's surface (e.g., 400 km for LEO)
  - **Distance**: Measured from Earth's center (e.g., 6771 km for LEO)
  - _Conversion_: Distance = Altitude + Earth radius (6371 km)

- Assumes instantaneous velocity changes (impulsive burns) and neglects atmospheric drag and gravitational perturbations.

- Calculations are specific to transfers around Earth.

- **Transfer time** is half the orbital period of the transfer ellipse.
