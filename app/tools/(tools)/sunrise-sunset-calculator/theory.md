### About This Calculator

This calculator uses the IPGeolocation Astronomy API to fetch accurate information about the sunrise/sunset and moonrise/moonset times. It sends the date and location to the API, and can interpret the results using any standard time zone locally.

### Sunset/sunrise

The sunset and sunrise times are mainly influenced by the axial tilt of the Earth (about 23.44 degrees), which changes which parts of the Earth are exposed more to the Sun throughout the year. For example, because of the axial tilt, the poles cycle between 6 months of darkness and 6 months of daylight, regardless of Earth's rotation around its own axis, since they will always either be pointed towards the Sun or away from it.

### Moonrise/moonset

The moonrise and moonset times are influenced by the Moon's orbit around the Earth, causing a ~50 minute delay per day.

Here is a table showing the moonrise and moonset times by moon phase:

| Moon Phase | Moonrise | Moonset |
|------------|----------|---------|
| New Moon   | 06:00    | 18:00   |
| Waxing Crescent | 09:00    | 21:00   |
| First Quarter | 12:00    | 00:00   |
| Waxing Gibbous | 15:00    | 03:00   |
| Full Moon   | 18:00    | 06:00   |
| Waning Gibbous | 21:00    | 09:00   |
| Last Quarter | 00:00    | 12:00   |
| Waning Crescent | 03:00    | 15:00   |
