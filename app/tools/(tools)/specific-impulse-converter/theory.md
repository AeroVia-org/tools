## Definition

**Specific Impulse (Isp)** is a measure of how efficiently a rocket engine uses propellant. It represents the impulse (change in momentum) produced per unit of propellant mass consumed.

## Mathematical Relationships

**Primary Formula:** `Isp = F / (ṁ × g₀)`

**Where:**

- F = Thrust force (N)
- ṁ = Mass flow rate (kg/s)
- g₀ = Standard gravity = 9.80665 m/s²

**Effective Exhaust Velocity:** `vₑ = Isp × g₀`

## Unit Conversions

- **Seconds:** Isp in seconds (most common unit)
- **m/s:** Effective exhaust velocity = Isp × 9.80665
- **ft/s:** Effective exhaust velocity in feet per second = Isp × 32.174
- **km/s:** Effective exhaust velocity in kilometers per second = Isp × 0.00980665

## Physical Interpretation

- Higher Isp means more efficient propellant usage
- Isp represents the "gas mileage" of a rocket engine
- Directly related to exhaust velocity - faster exhaust = higher Isp
- Affects mission delta-v capability through the rocket equation

## Performance Categories

- **< 200s:** Low performance (cold gas, some monopropellants)
- **200-300s:** Moderate performance (hydrazine, basic bipropellants)
- **300-400s:** Good performance (LOX/RP-1, LOX/LH2)
- **400-500s:** High performance (optimized LOX/LH2)
- **500-1000s:** Very high performance (electric propulsion)
- **> 1000s:** Exceptional performance (advanced electric, nuclear)

## Common Applications

- **Cold Gas:** 150-200s - Simple, reliable, low thrust
- **Monopropellant:** 200-250s - Hydrazine for satellites
- **Bipropellant:** 300-450s - Most launch vehicles and spacecraft
- **Electric Propulsion:** 1000-5000s - Deep space missions, station keeping
- **Nuclear Thermal:** 800-1000s - Proposed for Mars missions

## Design Considerations

- Higher Isp requires more complex engine designs
- Electric propulsion has high Isp but low thrust
- Chemical rockets balance Isp with thrust requirements
- Mission requirements determine optimal Isp range
- Cost and complexity increase with higher performance

## Historical Context

The concept of specific impulse was developed in the early days of rocketry to compare different propellant combinations. It remains one of the most important metrics for evaluating propulsion system performance and mission feasibility.
