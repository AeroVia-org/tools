## What is a Normal Shock Wave?

A normal shock wave is a thin, nearly discontinuous region where flow properties change abruptly. It occurs when:

- Supersonic flow (M₁ > 1) transitions to subsonic flow (M₂ < 1)
- The shock front is perpendicular to the flow direction
- Properties change significantly across a very short distance

## Key Normal Shock Properties

- Supersonic flow (M₁ > 1) becomes subsonic (M₂ < 1)
- Static pressure increases (p₂ > p₁)
- Static temperature increases (T₂ > T₁)
- Density increases (ρ₂ > ρ₁)
- Total pressure decreases (p₀₂ < p₀₁) due to entropy generation
- Total temperature remains constant (T₀₂ = T₀₁)

## Applications

### Supersonic Inlets

Normal shocks occur in supersonic aircraft inlets, slowing airflow to subsonic speeds for the engine.

### Wind Tunnels

Used in supersonic wind tunnel design and for experimental measurements of supersonic flow.

### Pitot Tubes

Pitot tubes in supersonic flow create normal shocks, allowing Mach number determination from pressure measurements.
