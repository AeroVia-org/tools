The Mach number (M) is the ratio of an object's speed to the local speed of sound. It is named after Austrian physicist Ernst Mach.

The speed of sound varies with altitude due to changes in air temperature and density. At sea level on a standard day, the speed of sound is approximately 343 m/s (1,235 km/h).

## Flight Regimes

- **Subsonic:** M < 0.8
- **Transonic:** 0.8 ≤ M < 1.0
- **Supersonic:** 1.0 ≤ M < 3.0
- **High Supersonic:** 3.0 ≤ M < 5.0
- **Hypersonic:** 5.0 ≤ M < 10.0
- **High Hypersonic:** M ≥ 10.0

This calculator uses the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model to determine local air properties at the specified altitude.
