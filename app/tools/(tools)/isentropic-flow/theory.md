## What is Isentropic Flow?

Isentropic flow is a compressible fluid flow where entropy remains constant. This occurs when:

- The flow is adiabatic (no heat transfer)
- The flow is reversible (no viscous effects or friction)
- No shock waves are present
- The fluid can be modeled as a perfect gas

## Key Properties and Terminology

- **Stagnation properties**: Values when flow is brought to rest isentropically (denoted with subscript ₀)
- **Area ratio (A/A\*)**: Ratio of local area to the critical area where M=1
- **Mach angle (μ)**: Angle of Mach waves in supersonic flow, calculated as sin⁻¹(1/M)
- **Prandtl-Meyer function (ν)**: Maximum angle through which supersonic flow can turn in expansion

## Applications

### Nozzle Design

Isentropic flow relations are used in designing rocket and jet engine nozzles to properly expand supersonic exhaust flow.

### Wind Tunnel Testing

Used to calculate flow conditions in different parts of supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnels for aerodynamic testing.

### Supersonic Inlets

For designing efficient inlets for supersonic aircraft that slow down air with minimum total pressure loss.
