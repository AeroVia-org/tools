- Calculations are for circular orbits around Earth.

- Assumes a perfectly spherical Earth with standard gravitational parameter (μ = GM) and radius.

- Does not account for atmospheric drag, gravitational anomalies, or perturbations from other celestial bodies (like the Moon or Sun).

- **Velocity** is the tangential speed required to maintain the circular orbit, calculated as v = √(μ / r), where r is the orbital radius (Earth radius + altitude).

- **Period** is the time taken to complete one full orbit, calculated as T = 2π √(r³ / μ).
