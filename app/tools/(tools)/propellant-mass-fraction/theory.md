- The **Propellant Mass Fraction (PMF)** is a measure of the vehicle's performance, indicating how much of the total mass is propellant.

- It is defined as the ratio of the propellant mass (`m_p`) to the initial (total) mass (`m_0`) of the vehicle.

- Formula: `PMF = m_p / m_0 = m_p / (m_s + m_p)`, where `m_s` is the structural mass (dry mass).

- A higher PMF generally means a more efficient design, as more mass is dedicated to fuel than structure.

- This value is crucial for calculating the performance capabilities using the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.
