- The **Thrust-to-Weight Ratio (TWR)** is a dimensionless parameter that compares the thrust force produced by an engine to the weight of the vehicle.

- It is defined as the ratio of thrust (`T`) to weight (`W`): `TWR = T / W = T / (m × g)`

- Where `m` is the mass of the vehicle and `g` is the gravitational acceleration (9.80665 m/s² on Earth).

- **TWR > 1:** The vehicle can accelerate vertically upward and hover in place.

- **TWR = 1:** The vehicle can hover but cannot accelerate vertically upward.

- **TWR < 1:** The vehicle cannot hover or take off vertically; it requires horizontal motion for lift (like airplanes).

- For rockets, TWR typically ranges from 1.2 to 2.0 at liftoff, allowing for acceleration against gravity and atmospheric drag.

- For aircraft, TWR is usually much less than 1, as they rely on aerodynamic lift rather than thrust for vertical support.

- Higher TWR values provide better acceleration and maneuverability but require more powerful engines and more fuel consumption.

- The TWR changes during flight as fuel is consumed and mass decreases, often improving throughout the flight for rockets.
