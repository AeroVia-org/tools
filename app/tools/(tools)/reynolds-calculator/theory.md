The Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless quantity that helps predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. It is defined as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid.

## Formula

**Re = ρvL/μ = vL/ν**

**Where:**

- ρ = fluid density (kg/m³)
- v = flow velocity (m/s)
- L = characteristic length (m)
- μ = dynamic viscosity (kg/(m·s))
- ν = kinematic viscosity (m²/s)

**For different geometries, L is:**

- Pipe flow: Diameter
- Airfoil: Chord length
- Flat plate: Length from leading edge
- Sphere/cylinder: Diameter

## Flow Regimes

### Internal Flow (pipes, ducts)

- **Laminar:** Re < 2,300
- **Transitional:** 2,300 ≤ Re < 4,000
- **Turbulent:** Re ≥ 4,000

### External Flow (airfoils, obstacles)

- **Laminar:** Re < 3 × 10⁵
- **Transitional:** 3 × 10⁵ ≤ Re < 5 × 10⁵
- **Turbulent:** Re ≥ 5 × 10⁵

At higher Reynolds numbers, inertial forces dominate over viscous forces, leading to turbulent flow characterized by chaotic, irregular fluid motions. At lower Reynolds numbers, viscous forces are dominant, resulting in laminar flow with smooth, ordered fluid motion.
